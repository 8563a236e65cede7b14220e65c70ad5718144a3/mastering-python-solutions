===========

.. automodule:: eggs
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
   
   .. class:: NonExistingClass
      This class doesn't actually exist, but it's in the documentation now
              
       .. method:: non_existing_function()
       
          And this function does not exist either
